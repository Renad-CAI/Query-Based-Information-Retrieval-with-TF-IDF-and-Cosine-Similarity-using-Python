A healthy lifestyle is a vital part of our lives.
There are some things that we must do to live a healthy life.
The first thing to do is to ensure that you eat three meals a day.
These meals should have the right amount of all the food groups, which are carbohydrates, proteins,
fats, minerals, and vitamins. You should not eat any junk food, which is unhealthy for you.
The next thing is to exercise daily to maintain a healthy lifestyle. This can be jogging, running,
playing sports, dancing.
Exercise is essential not only for health but also for your skin and hair to look more delightful.
