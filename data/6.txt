How important is staying active?
Your body isnâ€™t made to sit around.
If joints and muscles are to be kept in good, working order they need regular exercise.
If you stop walking, they'll stop working.
Your body finds it much easier to deal with threats such as sickness, injury, or the occasional sugary or fatty snack if you are active.
Exercise also helps you maintain a healthy attitude to problems and mental pressures.
You gain less body fat, tire less easily and feel better.
Exercise gives you greater flexibility and strength, prevents boredom and helps you sleep.
It also helps you find new friends and learn new skills.
