Good health is not just the absence of disease or illness, it is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being.
This means eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, avoiding tobacco and drugs and getting plenty of rest.
Our bodies are like machines that require a balance of protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, minerals and water to stay in good working order.
Get the balance wrong and your health will suffer.
A balanced diet means eating only as many calories as you use during the day.
Any excess will be stored as fat if you eat more than you burn off.
