What type of foods should I avoid when I will healthy person?
Many people do not buy and prepare fresh food, and it's easy to see why.
We are often short of time, and cheap, highly processed convenience food is always available.
However, convenience food has a negative impact on our health. Here are a few examples of this type of food:
junk food, like crisps and chocolate, is high in calories but low in nutritional value;
fast food, such as hamburgers and fried chicken, is prepared and served quickly but is high in fat;
convenience food, such as microwave ‘ready meals’, often has too much salt and sugar.
