Having a healthy lifestyle is all about choosing to live your life in the most healthy way possible.
There are a few things you have to do to start living your life in this way,
i.e., the healthy way. This means doing some amount of exercise daily, such as jogging, yoga,
playing sports, etc. Adding to this, 
you must also have a balanced and nutritional diet with all the food groups.
It would be best if you were taking the right amount of proteins, carbohydrates,
vitamins, minerals, and fats to help you have a proper diet.
Grouped with these two essential aspects (diet and exercise),
a healthy person also maintains the same sleep cycle, which should consist of around seven-eight hours of sleep.
